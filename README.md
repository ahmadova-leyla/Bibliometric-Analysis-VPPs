**Abstract:**

In recent years integration of renewable energy sources has become an important task for electricity power systems  globally. In this scenario a novel technology called Virtual 
Power Plant (VPP) has emerged during the last decades. The main objectives of  VPPs are to ensure the optimal production and integration of renewables  into power systems. 
This study provides a bibliometric review of scientific publications related to developments in the VPP field of research for the last decade  in countries like the USA, Australia,
UK, Germany and Italy. The aim of analysis is to provide information about current state of the research, impactful developments made in the field for the last decade and possible 
future directions of the field. 


**Working with the repository:**

Reposity containts  dataset, notebook script and plots. Each script can be executed independently on a prefered notebook app (vscode, jupiterlab, colab). Python script is intended for macOS, using  Python 3.11 version. Noteboo files are orginized as follows:

- usa_j_notebook.ipynb is a cript containing results for USA.
- au_j_notebook.ipynb is a script containing results for Australia.
- uk_j_notebook.ipynb is a script containing results for UK.
- ger_j_notebook.ipynb is a script containing results for Germany.
- it_j_notebook.ipynb is a script containing results for Italy.
- network.ipynb is a scrip containing result for collaboration analysis.
